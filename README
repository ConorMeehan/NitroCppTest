# Nitro C++ Proficiency Test

This is Conor Meehan's submission for the Nitro C++ Proficiency Test

## 3rd Party Libraries
I used two third party libraries. Catch is a c++ testing framework and nlohmann::json is a json parser. Both have been included as source in the 3rdParty folder.

# Building / Testing

To build the program you will need cmake > 3.1. The tests build as a separate application(NitroCppTest_Tests) using the catch framework.

## Linux/Cygwin
On linux/cygwin, navigate to the build directory and type the following:
	cmake ..
	make
    ./NitroCppTest_Tests
	./NitroCppTest_Main <inputFile>

## Windows	
On windows, you can use the cmake gui or navigate to the VisualStudio folder and type:
	cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017"

Then open the generated visual studio project and build. You can then run both the tests and main applications by selecting the appropriate start-up application.

## Other platforms
Other platforms and generators are untested but should work by selecting the correct generator in cmake.
